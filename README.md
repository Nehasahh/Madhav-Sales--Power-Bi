# Madhav E-commerce Sales Dashboard Project

# Objective
I developed an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze Madhav E-commerce's online sales data. The goal was to provide clear insights into sales trends, performance metrics, and customer behavior, enabling the business to make informed decisions for optimization.

# Project Steps:

1. Data Cleaning & Preparation
* Removed Duplicates & Incomplete Data: Ensured that the dataset was free of duplicate records and null entries to maintain data quality.
* Date Formatting: Standardized the date format and extracted useful time data such as month, quarter, and year for dynamic filtering.

2. Interactive Dashboard Development Visualizations Used
* Slicers: Created dynamic slicers to filter data by Quarter (Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4) and State for a more detailed view. This allowed users to explore trends in different states and time periods.
* Bar Chart: Visualized Top Customers by Profit and Monthly Profit trends, helping to identify the most valuable customers and monthly profit variations.
* Column Chart: Compared Profit by State and Sub-Categories, making it easy to spot which areas and sub-categories contribute the most to profitability.
* Donut Charts: Mode of Payment by Category: Analyzed how customers paid for furniture, electronics, and clothing, allowing for insights into customer preferences in each category.
* Quantity by Category: Visualized product quantities sold across categories, providing a quick understanding of sales volume.
* Custom Visuals: Employed additional custom visuals to bring clarity to complex data points, offering easy-to-understand insights at a glance.

3. Advanced Functionalities
* Slicers and Filters: Utilized advanced filtering options like slicers by region and product categories, allowing the business to dynamically explore specific areas of interest.
* Drill-Down Capabilities: Implemented drill-down features in charts, enabling users to view data at multiple levels—such as breaking down product sales into categories and sub-categories for a deeper understanding.

# Conclusion & Learnings:
This project sharpened my ability to transform raw data into actionable insights using Power BI’s advanced functionalities. Through customized visuals, dynamic filters, and DAX measures, I was able to create a highly interactive dashboard that provided a comprehensive view of Madhav E-commerce's sales data. This dashboard can now help the company optimize sales strategies, better target customer segments, and improve profitability.

# Key Outcomes:
* Improved insights into product category performance and profit trends by region.
* Clear visualization of sales patterns and customer behavior across different time frames.
* Enhanced data-driven decision-making for future sales strategies.
* This project demonstrates my ability to handle complex datasets, perform data analysis, and develop professional, user-friendly Power BI dashboards that deliver actionable business insights.
